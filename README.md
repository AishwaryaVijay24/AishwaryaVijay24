# 👋 Hi, I’m Aishwarya Vijay

I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at **Queen Mary University of London**, with a strong interest in building reliable, real-world AI systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of **machine learning, software engineering, and research**, turning ideas into practical, well-designed solutions.

My experience spans end-to-end product development, applied AI, and research-driven projects — from building MVPs and AI features for live platforms to contributing to an **IEEE-accepted conference paper**. I’m particularly motivated by problems where correctness, robustness, and thoughtful trade-offs matter as much as performance.
